					<h2 class="header tall2">What is captioning?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_what.jpg" alt="Example of a video with captioning.">
					<div class="description">
						We use “captioning” as a blanket term for the readable text of anything being spoken. People are most familiar with captioning on television broadcasts. CaptionAccess provides non-broadcast captioning for live events and captioning for pre-recorded media. Word-for-word captioning is often called CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation). We also offer a condensed form of live captioning, sometimes referred to as meaning-for-meaning translation. Try both, see which you prefer. Either way, we’ll make you well connected.

				<li class="tall2">
					<h2 class="header tall2">Who would want captioning?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_who.jpg" alt="Captioning in the classroom">
					<div class="description">
						Deaf and hard-of-hearing people use captioning to understand what is being said in any life situation – business meetings, school classes, webinars, public events, teleconferences, church services...the works. Use of captioning as a means to provide communication access increases each year and will continue to grow as more people learn about it as a means of access.
						<br />
						But captioning isn’t just for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, it benefits everyone. Many people with normal hearing need captioning to understand what is being said on television in noisy places, such as sports bars and health clubs. People who learn English as a second language often understand English text better than speech. Significantly, captioning creates a transcript that can serve as a record of webinars, business meetings, and classroom lectures. Transcripts also can be posted online, giving the website’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a> a boost.

					<h2 class="header tall4">Why captioning instead of sign language interpreting?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_sign_language.jpg" alt="Picture of a conversation in sign language">
					<div class="description">
						According to <a href="http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/14/hearing-loss-affects-1-in-5-americans-study-finds/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, there are 48 million deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the United States. <a href="http://www.ccdhh.com/PDF/ASL_Fact_Sheet.pdf">Only about 500,000 use American Sign Language</a> as a main mode of communication and typically choose sign language interpreters for their communication access. The rest of those 48 million use various combinations of amplified hearing, speechreading, assistive listening technology, and text (captioning!) to understand what people are saying. This group benefits the most from captioning--a whopping one fifth of all Americans.

				<li class="tall2">
					<h2 class="header tall4">What is the difference between live captioning and post-production captioning?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_difference.jpg" alt="Picture of a microphone in a production studio setup">
					<div class="description">
						Captioning that happens live as a speaker is talking is referred to as realtime captioning. The text version of what is being said appears almost instantaneously on the screen of a PC, laptop, tablet, projector, or smartphone. Post-production, or pre-recorded, captioning is the process of adding text to existing video or audio. Examples of this include captioned videos and webcasts posted online or archived on websites as on-demand events. Post-production work involves time-coding the text so the captioning syncs exactly with the speaker’s words. Just as importantly, CaptionAccess editors make sure the words themselves are exactly right.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="tall">
					<h2 class="header tall3">Why can’t we just use speech recognition technologies?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_speech_recognition.jpg" alt="Picture of a microphone used for speech recognition">
					<div class="description">
						Yes, people ask this question all the time. If you can do a web search or text message by voice on a cellphone, why can’t you use automatic speech recognition (ASR) to caption a business meeting? Because you can’t. Although amazing strides have been made in ASR technology, ASR has yet to achieve the accuracy where it can dependably be used for communication access. ASR depends largely on familiarity with the speaker’s voice and the specific terminology used. The error rate of ASR can be quite high making it unreadable--even comically so--in whole or in part. Check out automatic captioning on YouTube and judge for yourself.

				</li>
				<li class="tall">
					<h2 class="header tall3">CaptionAccess works remotely. Why?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_remote.jpg" alt="Picture of a remote location">
					<div class="description">
						Technology allows CaptionAccess to provide remote captioning anywhere there is a good Internet connection, which is almost everywhere these days. With remote captioning, customers save money by not having to pay for captioners to travel, park, and sometimes stay in hotels to work on site. What’s more, many of our customers appreciate not having an extra person in the room calling attention to the fact that they’re receiving special services. Remote captioning also gives us greater flexibility to provide short-notice services and deal with last-minute schedule changes. We don’t have to be in the neighborhood to do the job.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2 class="header">How is remote captioning done?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_how_remote.jpg" alt="Picture of captioners on teleconference">
					<div class="description">
						The remote captioner listens to the speakers via teleconferencing or an Internet audio source, such as Skype or GoToMeeting. The captioner then creates the text using a stenotype machine, re-voicing technology, or advanced abbreviation software. That text is transmitted through cyberspace and appears on an Internet-capable display device. It’s pretty simple actually, and highly effective.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2 class="header">What do I need on my end to get captioning?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_need.jpg" alt="Picture of equipment needed for the captioning process">
					<div class="description">
						For classes, business meetings, and many other events, you will need a stable Internet connection, a microphone, an audio link, and a device to display the captioning. Having a good-quality mic and audio link are especially important because captioning quality depends on the ability of the captioner to hear the discussion. We can recommend a mic and audio setup appropriate for your situation. And our free demo also can come in handy.

				<li class="closer">
					<h2 class="header">Does captioning meet compliance requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_ada.jpg" alt="Americans with Disabilities Act logo">
					<div class="description">
						State and federal civil rights laws, such as the ADA, prohibit discrimination against individuals who require special accommodations. Captioning fulfills <a href="http://www.nad.org/issues/technology/captioning/when-required">ADA requirements for communication access</a>. In determining how government regulations apply to your situation, don’t hesitate to contact us.

				<li class="closer">
					<h2 class="header tall4">Can I see how this works?</h2>
					<img src="images/faq_demo.jpg" alt="Picture of a LIVE recording sign">
					<div class="description">
						Absolutely! Contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@captionaccess.com?subject=Free%20Demo%20-%20FAQ">contact@captionaccess.com</a> or <a href="http://www.captionaccess.com/contact">our contact form</a> and we’ll give you a free demonstration of our remote services free of charge. We love to show people how easy it is to turn speech into caption access!

						<p>“Technology is changing the way people receive information and the way people are trained and educated. When educational webcasts are not captioned then people who are deaf or hard of hearing don’t have the same access or the same opportunity to learn that people who can hear do. It's so easy and inexpensive to get webcasts captioned — If webcasters knew how many more people they could reach with the simple addition of captions, it would seem a no brainer to add them. CaptionAccess is unusual among captioning companies in that it advocates and educates for online inclusion in addition to providing services to make it happen.”</p>

						<p>“It has been a pleasure working with CaptionAccess. SIU requires the use of remote CART services for both an online student and a student onsite. CaptionAccess delivers first-rate captioning services in a professional, dedicated manner. They are easy to work with and have gone above and beyond the call of duty by traveling to the classroom to provide technical hands-on assistance. We would recommend CaptionAccess to any school that requires the use of all-around quality captioning services.”</p>

						<p>“CaptionAccess has provided captioning for deaf and hard-of-hearing participants for all Inside Higher Ed webinars since September, 2012. We do as many as four a month, on topics that range from the arcane (competency education and assessment) to the REALLY arcane (game design elements in online course development). We can have as many as four presenters talking over each other in fast-paced events. CaptionAccess does a fantastic job -- captioners are scheduled quickly, show up on time, do a wonderful job during the live event, and provide transcripts in 24 hours (often less). The good will Inside Higher Ed has accrued by providing this simple (and very economical) service is enormous. And CaptionAccess is a genuine pleasure to work with.”</p>

						<p>“As filmmakers, it is our primary goal to connect and effectively communicate with our audience, which is why we chose CaptionAccess to caption both our movie trailer and our feature documentary, "I'm Fine, Thanks."  Without captioning, we are limiting the effectiveness of our storytelling.  We see captioning as an essential piece in our storytelling arsenal and CaptionAccess made this additional tool very successful for us.”</p>

						<p>“CaptionAccess has opened my eyes to the value of captioning, transcribing, and generally making the work I do online more accessible. By providing access, I'm getting deaf and hard-of-hearing people signing up for workshops and events they never could have signed up for before… which means more sales, which means more income. Consider me sold!”</p>

						<p>“Industry leaders across all private, public and non-profit sectors express a commitment to diversity, but the principle is often overlooked when applied to people with disabilities. A prime example of this oversight is non-captioned videos and webinars, which send potential consumers, customers, and partners the message: "you are not wanted here." As more of us acquire the tools to produce online content, it is critical that we integrate captioning into our programming. This will benefit not only people who are Deaf and hard of hearing, but also people learning English, children learning to read, airport travelers, and many others. Like many things related to accessibility, what works well for people with disabilities, works well for just about everybody.”</p>

						<p>“Organization meetings, whether for-profit or non-profit, are costly and it's best to have everyone on the 'same page' to maximize productivity and meaningful exchange among all there. Inclusion of CART is so useful for the group, since participants can maximize their various skills while having the transcript to review after the meeting too. Companies like CaptionAccess provide vital services for millions of people who need captioning for communication.”</p>
