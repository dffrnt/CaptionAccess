						“Technology is changing the way people receive information and the way people are trained and educated. When educational webcasts are not captioned then people who are deaf or hard of hearing don’t have the same access or the same opportunity to learn that people who can hear do. It's so easy and inexpensive to get webcasts captioned — If webcasters knew how many more people they could reach with the simple addition of captions, it would seem a no brainer to add them. CaptionAccess is unusual among captioning companies in that it advocates and educates for online inclusion in addition to providing services to make it happen.”

We can have as many as four presenters talking over each other in fast-paced events. CaptionAccess does a fantastic job -- captioners are scheduled quickly, show up on time, do a wonderful job during the live event, and provide transcripts in 24 hours (often less). The good will Inside Higher Ed has accrued by providing this simple (and very economical) service is enormous. And CaptionAccess is a genuine pleasure to work with.”</p>

A prime example of this oversight is non-captioned videos and webinars, which send potential consumers, customers, and partners the message: "you are not wanted here." As more of us acquire the tools to produce online content, it is critical that we integrate captioning into our programming. This will benefit not only people who are Deaf and hard of hearing, but also people learning English, children learning to read, airport travelers, and many others. Like many things related to accessibility, what works well for people with disabilities, works well for just about everybody.”</p>
